# PomoBuddy üçÖ

## Overview

PomoBuddy is a Pomodoro Timer App designed to help individuals manage their work time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique aims to improve focus and productivity.

## Why I made this?
PomoBuddy serves a significant purpose for me and my college friends. As students, we often find ourselves overwhelmed with assignments, projects, and studying for exams. PomoBuddy emerged from our collective need for a tool that could help us manage our time more effectively and improve our productivity.
